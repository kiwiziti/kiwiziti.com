Around a year into our relationship when things were getting more serious 
(and as the pandemic wore on), we decided to adopt two adorable sister 
kitties Kiwi and Ziti.

A fun fact is that [Paws4ever](https://paws4ever.org/), the shelter we adopted 
them from, is right across the road from our wedding venue! 

We weren't originally looking for two cats but when we met Kiwi
and Ziti we loved them immediately. We knew we could give them 
a good home.
